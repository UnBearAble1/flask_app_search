# flask_app_search

* This is going to be slightly more complicated to complete, so far I have set up the navbars to be a base.html file and navbar.html file for the V2 items. Will create a separate navbar for V1
* The searhc is largely for V1 since I greatly pared it down, however to do the search through flask, I will need to pass all of the current html documents into an SQL database, so I will need to create aritle forms and then submit them. The idea is to create the submission form and then use Python and Selenium to autocomplete the forms in a for loop so the content can then be searched. More complex but shouldn't be impossible
* Next step is to create the SQLAlchemy database in flask
