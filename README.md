# flask_app
Making a flask app for Laz's V2 game, just to test it out and try some stuff

## Day 1

doing some research here, figure out how to get the flaks app running, but it looks more like I want to do some HTML web pages. I say someone ask on stack overflwo about combining two web HTML webpages in flask, and it looks like people got it running, so lets try to start there tomorrow

goal for day 2 will be creating breadcrumbs, see how that goes, try to recreate the homepage for starters!

## Day 2
* Coming along well, created breadcrumbs without issue, linked html pages, created page for one skill
* Created internal page anchor and confirmed it is working as intended. There are way too many skills, will need to play around with presentation
* did some minor editing on the hexdrive master doc, will need to chat with client to see how he wants to proceed on that
* do not plan to do much over the weekend, next goals include
  * create landing page for viewer to see the intro currentnly on Wix and then let them pick game rules or character creation to start
  * create breadcrumbs across the 
  * Look at dropdown, may be another good way to organize everything
  * What to do about hosting the app

## Day 3
* Put in dropdown menus and updated top nav bar, things are looking good ot move forward
* Client has started adding items and chanig formatting, but again since this is just for fun, I'm not too worried, its more for me to get some practice
* Since the html and making templates is not overly challenging, at the conclusion I think it would be fun to script something to help with building abilities as they are described in the stuff

## Day 4
* Goal for today - complete a single section
* Maybe create a landing page if it comes together, maybe wait till the end and you have everything else, then see how it all fits together
* ended up complete two sections, something to revisit, padding around anchors may change based on expectations, maybe build a class for it in CSS
* Goal for Day 5 of project will be competing two more sections, one light and one challenging

## Day 5
* Working on Actions ,very complex
* Need to create tag ul class, adding into code to complete later
* Completed Actions, completed other rules, only 3 subs remain, can definitely get two completed tomorrow, maybe three if first two go quickly
* Leaving hardest one for last
* Goal for tomorrow, at least two pages, pushing for three and configur all navbars so it all points where it should
* For Laz, noticed that some items are not hyperlinked, do you want me to add then if I see it?

## Day 6
* Food supplies and moral  are low and several men have wandered off into the tundra, never to be seen again
* Aiming to be done with all templates today and then work tomorrow on launching for demo with laz over teh weekend
* Will have a lot of kinks to work out with launching I assume, no idea how the page linking will work since its hard coded in
* Evening update
* Got way more done than expected, finished all templates, created landing page, updated all addresses for how it will need to eb in the flask app and learned about the correct way to have images and javascript stored in file structure.
* Plan for tomorrow is to deploy before we start gaming
* Also need to get requirements file

## Day 7
* Added requirements.txt file
* Today is the day to publish online, laz gave me access to a hosting platform that he has, but not sure if it can do flask apps, kind of want to start with zeet which I found online and see if that works and then try laz's stuff...hrm..
* Laz also sent me the json for his other item, gonna have to open up a new project to work with all of that.. I feel like the goal for that is to get all of the data organized so we can easily access the document... it has all of the html so barebones copy and paste jsut for something super simple might work? We shall see.

And its launched! ended up using pythonanywhere, very simple instructions to get the flask app up and running. I would call this project a success! time to move onto the next one
