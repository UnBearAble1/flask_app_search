    <h1>Armor and Weapons</h1>
    <p>The world is filled with established weapons and armor with preset traits, but you get to design your own weapons and armor at character creation. Further, depending upon your base, you unlock additional benefits when using weapons or armor, as outlined below.</p>

    <a name="Armor"><h2 style="padding-top: 48px; margin-top: -48px;">Armor</h2></a>
    <p>Armor increases your serious and grievous wound thresholds against two of following damage types: slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing (at character creation, or if your character has a custom suit of armor made, you get to select which of the two.) In modern settings, ballistic is added to this list, and in futuristic settings, something like energy could be also. Armor does not protect against falling unless it has the impact resistant trait. Armor may also give you speed penalties or added difficulty when performing certain actions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Light Armor:  Provides a +2 Serious Wound Threshold</li>
        <li>Medium Armor: Provides a +4 Serious Wound Threshold and a +3 Grievous Wound Threshold.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Has the Inflexible 1 trait (You cannot critically succeed on the penalized actions shown below).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Heavy Armor: Provides a +6 Serious Wound Threshold and a +3 Grievous Wound Threshold.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Gives you a speed penalty of -5 feet.</li>
            <li>Has the Inflexible 2 trait (As Inflexible 1, but you also treat failures on the penalized actions shown below as Critical failures).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also gain added protection by wearing a helmet, though lose perception benefits. Unlike with core armor, warrior training does not provide any added benefit when wearing helmets. Putting a helmet on is an interact action, but strapping it on is a second action. If your helmet isnâ€™t strapped on, then receiving any wound to the head will knock your helmet to your feet. Raising or lowering a faceplate is a free action.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Light Helm: +2 SW and +1 GW Threshold</li>
        <ul>
            <li>-1 to Perception Checks </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Heavy Helm: +4 SW and +2 GW Threshold</li>
        <ul>
            <li>-2 to Perception Checks  (-1 with faceplate up). </li>
            <li>Limited field of vision</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Armor Traits.</b> Each suit of armor has three traits. If you are an adept, you gain access to the first trait. If you are a hybrid, you gain access to the first and second. If you are a warrior, you gain access to all three traits.  These are the available armor traits a suit of armor can have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile: Reduce the speed penalty for this armor by 5. </li>
        <li>Flexible: Reduce your Inflexible trait by 1 category (can be chosen once).</li>
        <li>Resilient: You get DR 5 against critical hits from damage types your armor protects against. </li>
        <li>Fortified: Your armor protects against a third damage type as well (can be selected more than once in modern or futuristic settings). </li>
        <li>Concealable: Your armor can be fully concealed within clothing (light armor only, must always be the first trait.)</li>
        <li>Comfort: The armor counts as one degree less heavy for the ability to rest in it. This is only beneficial if the armor counts as less than light, then you can rest in it normally. (can be chosen three times). </li>
        <li>Latched: You can don or doff this armor as a three action (contiguous) action per weight category (so 6 actions for medium, or 9 actions for heavy.) Each time you select this trait, you can reduce the number of actions by 3 (minimum 3 actions.) </li>
        <li>Spiked: You can make unarmed attacks with this armor that deal 1d6 piercing damage. Additionally, any creature that attempts to grapple or grab you takes 2d6 piercing damage, or 4d6 if they critically fail the attempt.</li>
        <li>Insulated: Your protection applies to cold, fire, electricity or acid attacks (pick each time you select this trait) </li>
        <li>Impact Resistant: Your protection applies to falling damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="Overview"><h2 style="padding-top: 48px; margin-top: -48px;">Weapons</h2></a>
    <p>Like armor, at character creation you get to design your own weapons. Your character can also have custom weapons crafted that follow the rules here. Otherwise, all other weapons are made with these rules as well, but have static traits based on the game setting.</p>
    <p>The more base damage a weapon does, the fewer traits it gets. The number of traits are also determined by whether the weapon requires one hand or two, or if the weapon is ranged.</p>
    <p>The maximum damage for a 1 handed weapon is 1d8. Ranged weapons that deal 1d10 damage require the reload 1 trait, and those that can get to 1d12 require the reload 2 trait.</p>
    <p>Ranged weapons have a default range of 40 feet, and Reload 0 (meaning they can be reloaded and attack in the same action, but it still counts as an 'interact' action).</p>

      <h3>Weapon Traits </h3>
      <p>Most weapon traits will differ depending upon whether the base of the wielder is an Adept, a Hybrid, or a Warrior. The more martial the character, the more skill they have in unlocking the truest potential from weapon traits.</p>
      <p>Not all traits are equal, however.  Some cost more trait "slots" than others.</p>

  <a name="Grappling">
    <h2 style="padding-top: 48px; margin-top: -48px;">Grappling</h2></a>
    <p>This weapon can be used to grapple with, even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus below to the grapple check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adept: +1 to checks to grapple</li>

    <p>A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. You can use an Interact action to thrash the weapon in a hex within the weaponâ€™s reach.

    <ul>
        <li>Adept: 1 adjacent hex</li>
        <li>Hybrid: 2 adjacent, connected hexes</li>
        <li>Warrior: 3 adjacent, connected hexes</li>
    </ul>

  <a name="Jousting">
    <h2 style="padding-top: 48px; margin-top: -48px;">Jousting</h2></a>
    <p>The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adept: +2 to damage</li>
        <li>Hybrid: +3 to damage</li>
        <li>Warrior: +4 to damage</li>

    <h2 style="padding-top: 48px; margin-top: -48px;">Modular</h2></a>
    <p>You can pick two sets of traits (each losing 1 to this to trait), and switch between the two for an action.</p>


  <a name="Parry">
    <h2 style="padding-top: 48px; margin-top: -48px;">Parry</h2></a>
    <p>You can spend a single action to position this weapon defensively, gaining a bonus.</p>

        <li>Hybrid: a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex defense against all single-target effects until the start of your next turn.</li>
